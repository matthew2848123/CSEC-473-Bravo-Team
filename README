INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

1. Run "source bravo-infra-openrc.sh" and input your openstack creds
2. Run ./makeInfra
3. Manually connect routers 2 3 and 4 to graynet in openstack with ips 192.168.1.4, .5, and .6 respectively
3. After the script exits, give the infra 10 minutes to turn on
4. Run "ansible-playbook ping.yml" to test status
5. Run "ansible-playbook networkingFix.yml" to fix networking for gray boxes
6. Run "ansible-playbook networkingFix2.yml" to fix networking for comp boxes

NOTE: Use the teardown.sh script to delete most of the infra, if needed (You will still likely need to clean the routers and networks up manually)
NOTE2: I have been unable to get the windows xp box to talk with ansible. If you want to fix it, please do.
NOTE3: The linux boxes can only be reached from gray net by their lower IP address. I think its a weird networking issue; all the comp boxes work fine. Just use the lower ips, or better yet, use their names from the provided inventory.ini file.
